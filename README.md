# dp87
This is a repository entirely for documenting the information, cad files, parts, and layout for my new keyboard build, the DP87. An entirely custom and unique paraTKL
build designed for gaming, data entry, and media consumption, manipulation, and creation. This is a 1 of 1 board and the firmware is being privatly developed.
